# Test Files

Use the .wav files in this folder to test the DTW speech recognition script.
Make sure the sound files are in the same folder as the script and functions. MATLAB can only access these files if they are in the right 'working directory'! So don't keep them in a separate folder within another folder.
The name of each sound file identifies its content ('Links', 'Midden' or 'Rechts'). It also indicates how 'typical' it is. '1', '2' and '3' are very typical pronounciations. T means a slightly less typical pronounciation. R means a very atypical pronounciation.
